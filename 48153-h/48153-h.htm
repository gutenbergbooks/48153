    </span> <span class="i0">Was worship&rsquo;d by a Fairy,<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">Who made for him a waistcoat trim<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">Of silk and satin, soft and airy,<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">Button&rsquo;d with eyes of fireflies<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">In manner military.<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">And more to move his languid love<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">A crimson cap she made him,<br />

    </span> <span class="i0">Of moths that rob the flowers&rsquo; honey;<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">And with her kisses, lovers&rsquo; money,<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">For that she gave she paid him.<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">She fed him too, till he was blue,<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">With endearing terms on caddis worms;<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">And caught for him the wriggling germs<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">Of midges; and with tender pats<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">She wiled and woo&rsquo;d him while he chew&rsquo;d &rsquo;em:<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">Till he said, &lsquo;Bother! I love another.<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">I love the Star I see afar,<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">That changeth oft her fires so soft<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">From blue to red and red to blue;<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">And that is why I love not you.<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">Therefore I pray you take away<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">Your tedious arm, which does me harm<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">Because it makes me feel too warm.<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">But give to me my new guitar<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">That I may sing to yonder Star.&rsquo;<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">With that he gaped and guggled so<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">The Fairy into fits did go;<br />
    </span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span> <span class="i0">And he bounded near and bounded far,<br />

    </span> <span class="i0">And tried to reach the Changing Star.<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">And all the while with his splay feet<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">Kept time unto the music meet.<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">With hat and waistcoat on he sprang,<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">And as he bounded still he sang.<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">And this the Saga says is why<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">The Frog he always jumps so high;<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">For, though the Star is very far,<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">To reach it he must ever try,<br />

    </span> <span class="i0">So he jump&rsquo;d up to punish the impudent Fay,<br />

    </span> <span class="i0">Until the old Mountain broke right down the middle,<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">When back he came nimbly and played on the fiddle.<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">My Advice to all Mountains that make such a stir, it&rsquo;s<br />

    </span> <span class="i0">Where Violets drink of dew their fill,<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">And wading thro&rsquo; wet eastern Flowers<br />

    </span> <span class="i0">To smoky Villages at eve,<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">The while toward their wattled home<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">The baaing Sheep do go, I roam,<br />

    </span> <span class="i0">On ranged boards mark Love and Hate<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">Egg on to midnight-living crime,<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">And glaring Horrors of dead time<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">Creep in behind. Or, restive still,<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">Unlock&rsquo;d from Hell soar Heaven&rsquo;s hill<br />

    </span> <span class="i0">The peep of Dawn, or flashing turn<br />

    </span> <span class="i0">And spouting silver-foamed leaks;<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">Of Gods reclined, and Maids who move,<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">Unlidding lustrous eyes of love;<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">Of War; of Wisdom with a skull.<br />

    </span> <span class="i0">Come. There no dew distilled mars<br />

    </span> <span class="i0">There solves to unpolluted flow<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">The crumbling crystals of the Snow;<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">And windworn Cataracts wavering plunge<br />

    </span> <span class="i0">Lest those faint Harmonies be unheard<br />

    </span> <span class="i0">By the light fingers of the Wind,<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">Run from the poised orbs swiftly spin&rsquo;d.&rsquo;<br />

    </span> <span class="i0">Time should be spent in huddling haste<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">To harry Ignorance to her den,<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">Or pink fat Folly with the pen?<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">Small unobserved things to use,<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">Each with its little mite of news,<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">To build that sheer hypothesis<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">Whose base on righteous Reason is,<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">Whose point among the Stars. For shame!<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">Enough the seeming-serious game.<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">But search the Depths; and for thy meed,<br />
    </span> <span class="i0">A place among the men indeed.&rsquo;<br />
